My name is Thiago Beier. 

I have a special interest in Cloud Technologies, Infrastrucure as a Code and Modern Workplace.

I'm also passionate by communities, tech talks and an evangelist of the Cloud culture because I truly understand its value for each person as user, developer, consultant, pre-sales, architects, project managers and management staff all over the world in each location where there's room for process improvement leveraging knowledge and making people's lives better.

Years ago I've created my [blog in PT-BR](http://thiagobeier.wordpress.com) that was later used to post in English. After I moved to Toronto, ON Canada I decided to keep the blog in English to help me to get closer to a broader audience and as well to keep up with the language skill used on my daily routine as an international student and now as a Microsoft Consultant for a Microsoft Partner.

Besides to create my own content in English here, I'll also use this space to save all information from different sources that I've been sharing at LinkedIn and Twitter.

### My History

In short:

I started as help desk support agent in 1999 at the same university I started my 3 years course so called Data Processing, which I didn't graduate from and moved to the networking team as part of the afterhours crew supporting Aix, Windows NT and Mainframe. Later then I moved to daily team having access to deep more on cabling, firewalls, proxy and routing and switching. The big change was moving to a Brazilian security technology developer where I could rump up knowledge around BSDs, Unix, Linux and a diverse new world around firewall, proxy, secure mail gateways from different vendors. That moved to the next step working for a local police department for almost 7 years from security to networking team then to Microsoft team where I became passionate for seeing all capabilities offered through Active Directory Domain Services and so many other roles and features attached fo Windows Server all over the years. 

* December/2011

After delivering projects for the Brazilian National Engergy Agency where we planned, migrated, managed one of the first NetApp metrocluster setup with Microsoft Private cloud offering System Center VMM, SCCM, DPM and SCOM I felt challenged by an old friend to take a new step on my career. I moved to a consulting team delivering Microsoft Solutions all over the Country for private and public clients with up to 180.000 seats. I could learn from the best, Active Directory, Microsoft Exchagne, VMM, SCCM, SCOM, Lync/Skype for Business and BPOS AKA on today's market as M365 (O3635) that really lead me to where I am today. At this time was challenged to pick myself up on things left behind such as Micrsoft certification and to graduate from a college. The Microsoft certification gave me a passion to learn and teach then I got my MCT (Microsoft Certified Trainer), after that I focused on stuyding English to follow along the tickets we escalated with Microsoft Customer Support mostly in English back at that time which moved back to an old project, to live abroad.


* Januray/2015 - **Mcirosoft Architect** for Microsoft Technologies mostly focused on ADDS, Exchagne, Skype for Business, System Center and FIM (Forefront Idendity Manager). All hard work paid off once I was doing well studying English for the "study & live abroad plan" and also trying a job applying for oppenings in Dublin, Brazil, USA and Canada that required English. After a long year I got an interview for AWS team in Dublin that I had to withdraw after I received a green light from a College in Canada

* August/2016 - **Hit Refresh** Arrived in Canada wife wife and two boys for a great family adventure, attend to a college on a foreign language in a city we had never been before. College started in September and kids went to school. After 3 months trying to find a part-time job close to home I got an interview on IT field on west side from where we lived. One e-mail, one call and after one in-person interview I got hired. That was the begining of a great experience in my life. Thank God for that.

* April/2018 - üôå **Graduation** It was finished! After two years with one summer break in between I graduated from college and continued working at the same company, a MSP (Managed Service Provider) until I found myself ready at least to try something new likewise I had before, to be a Microsoft Consultant again.

* April/2019 - Currently: üê±‚Äçüë§ **Microsoft Consultant** I work for one of the largest privately-owned IT services and solutions companies in North America, with offices across the continent at the Azure Infrastructure and Modern Workplace/M365 Team. 

I continue to strive towards the goals I've set to myself based on what I've received from God keeping a clear path of what's tangible and great for myself and my family.
