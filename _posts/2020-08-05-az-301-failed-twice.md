<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p><p style="text-align:justify;">Hi there</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><img class=" aligncenter" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://thiagobeierblog.blob.core.windows.net/posts/whydowefall.jpg" width="202" height="286" /></p><p>To be honest writing this post was quite sad but I'm sure I'm not the only one having issues accomplishing some goals on regards to Technical Certification.</p><p>I failed AZ-301 on July 7th , 2020 - with a total score of 608</p><p>I failed AZ-301 again on July 31st, 2020 - with a total score of 671</p><p>Comparing the 2 score reports I realized that I need more exposure to doing , piloting and creating LABs of each feature/component I can name it:</p><ul><li>Azure functions</li><li>Azure web apps</li><li>Azure event hubs</li><li>Azure logic apps</li><li>Azure service bus</li><li>Azure analytics</li><li>Azure storage accounts</li><li>Azure *.*</li></ul><p>Even after following the AZ-301 guides found at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-301 and at the Exam outline https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE3VEHD I failed by the 1st time (I started to study to this cert on Feb 2020)</p><p>After I failed the first time I found the AZ-301 practice test at whizlabs.com and I booked my exam retake with almost 4 weeks in advance to have time to practice and check each link provided by <a href="https://www.whizlabs.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whizlabs</a> platform to improve all skills needed to pass on the exam.</p><p>After I took each Practice Test (total of 5) and failed by the 1st time I took notes of each link for each incorrect question, opened each one and read them all and I got surprise with the amount of information that's required to clear this exam. I kept retaking the practices tests daily until the exam day.</p><p>After I failed by the 2nd time I decided to move forward on Certification Plan for 2020 however, skipping AZ-301 until I'm confident with all skills for each core skills subject asked on the exam. That reminds me that it's always good to have exposure to at least 75% of the exam through Labs and projects if you can't make it through reading and watching recorded training after a long period of time.</p><p>Wish you success after your hard work on studying, improving skills and figuring a great way to clear your exams on a way that satisfies yourself.</p><p><!-- /wp:paragraph -->
