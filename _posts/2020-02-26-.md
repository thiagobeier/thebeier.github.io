Hi there

In this post I'm covering the Office 365 Pro Plus click-to-run deployment no SCCM CB (Current Branch)

SCCM build number:

SCCM client build number:

OS: Windows Server 2016 build:

Targeted OS types: Windows 10 x64

Additional OS types on network / domain: Windows 10 x86, Windows 7

<span style="color:#ff0000;">Attention</span>: Office 365 Pro Plus deployment through SCCM detects previous Office deployments and removes it completely or skips Project, Visio and XXX if required. Check Office compatibility with previous Project and Vision versions before you deploy it. First of all, target the deployment to a SANDBOX collection (Pilot Collection).
<ol>
	<li>create the collection where Office 365 Pro Plus will be targeted to</li>
	<li>make sure the domain joined workstations are healthy at the SCCM console</li>
	<li>make sure your DPs (Distribution Points are healthy and receiving the packages your're creating / distributing)</li>
	<li>make sure you have your boundaries and boundary groups well set up.</li>
	<li>go to SCCM console at XXXX</li>
	<li>select XXXX</li>
	<li>click on XXX to Run through the Office 365 Pro Plus OCT (Office Customization Toolkit) wizard</li>
	<li>step 1</li>
	<li>step 2</li>
	<li>you're finished</li>
	<li>check the SOURCES folder to see the Office package in there</li>
	<li>check the logs at C:\Users\t%username%\AppData\Local\Temp temp folder (you can check the Office package download status and see it it's really happening - this download might takes 40 to 60 minutes depending on your server specs and internet link speed).</li>
</ol>
You can check your customization file after at https://config.office.com

You can have different Office 365 Pro Plus packages with different Office Apps configured for setup / distribution i.e.: Field Department PCs/Users get basic office package (Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook), Finance Department PCs/users get full Office package (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams, OneNote and OneDrive)

Bare in mind if you have Windows 7 (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/4057281/windows-7-support-ended-on-january-14-2020">EOL notice</a>) you might need to have a pre-pilot for them as well as think about hardware and OS upgrade.

thanks,
