Hi there

This article is covering how to go <em><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/identity/passwordless" target="_blank" rel="noopener">passwordless</a></em> on Office 365 with Yubikey 5 NFC from Yubico.

<strong>How to sign in with a security key</strong>
There are different types of security keys that you can use, like a USB key that you plug in to your device or an NFC key that you tap on an NFC reader. Make sure to familiarize yourself with the type of security key you have by reading the instruction manual from the manufacturer.
<ol>
	<li>Go to the Microsoft account page and sign in as you normally would.</li>
	<li>Select Security &gt; More security options and under Windows Hello and security keys, select Set up a security key.</li>
	<li>Identify what type of key you have (USB or NFC) and select Next.</li>
	<li>You will be redirected to the setup experience where you will insert or tap your key.</li>
	<li>Create a PIN (or enter an existing PIN if you have already created one).</li>
	<li>Take the follow-up action by touching either the button or gold disk if your key has one (or read the instruction manual to figure out what else it might be).</li>
	<li>Name your security key so that you can distinguish it from other keys.</li>
	<li>Sign out and open Microsoft Edge, select Use Windows Hello or security key instead, and sign in by inserting or tapping your key.</li>
</ol>
