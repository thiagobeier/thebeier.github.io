 [Ravi Yadav](https://scomandothergeekystuff.com)
 Ravi is a not only a MVP for me he's more than that. He helped when I most needed someone to motivate me and welcomed he on his Team where we worked together. As a Team Lead he was there when we needed him showing the best way to approach client, project deliverables and as well how to improve knowledge as we got engaged on projects.
