### Scripts repository

New and all scripts from Technet Gallery moved to here.

**What am I doing?**

-   I am publishing my previous Microsfot Technet Gallery scripts files on
    GitHub to keep it live on tech community.

-   This GitHub repository helps me to organize some scripts and skills that
    I've developped throughout my learning, labs and projects challenges.

-   Within this repository there will be lab guides in PDF format, PowerShell
    scripts, VBS scripts and customization files such as JSON files, XML files
    and so on and so forth.
